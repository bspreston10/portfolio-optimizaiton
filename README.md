## Final Thoughts
Although this portfolio produced an large annual return of 46% the volatility makes this portfolio a very risky strategy. Something also interesting about this portfolio is that the graph shows a postively correlated linear relationship for return and volatility, when the efficient frontier's shape should be closer to a cluster of data following a curve toward the y axis. After doing further analysis on this strange instance the problem turned out to be that the stocks were highly correlated to one another creating an instance where the success of a single market determines the success of the portfolio.

  - Expected Return: 19.37%

## Final Thoughts
This portfolio, although its expected return is only 19%, has a much smaller risk than the one created before. The differences in these portfolios include a minimum limit of 0.01 on weight to make sure that every stock is utilized in the portfolio, and a more diverse stock selection that covers a wider range of markets.
