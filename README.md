## Final Thoughts
Although this portfolio produced an large annual return of 46% the volatility makes this portfolio a very risky strategy. Something also interesting about this portfolio is that the graph shows a postively correlated linear relationship for return and volatility, when the efficient frontier's shape should be closer to a cluster of data following a curve toward the y axis. After doing further analysis on this strange instance the problem turned out to be that the stocks were highly correlated to one another creating an instance where the success of a single market determines the success of the portfolio.

# Portfolio 2:
